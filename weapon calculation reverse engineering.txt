Damage Calc (Rh1) - physical

Character Sheet Final ## ->

Check R21 (Rounded final) - takes rough number checks if greater than 0 and if so rounds to 2 decimal places or returns - ## ->

Non reounded number checks CN2 ## ->

Check if throwable in weaponData 
	If it make a lookup to ConsumableData and fetch attackBasePhysics
	If NOT lookup weapon in EquipParamWeapon using weaponID + Afinity as the ID for lookup and get attackBasePhysics
Multiply value returned by inital lookup and multiply by physicsAtkRate from ReinforceParamWeapon using reinforcement level + reinforcementTypeId as ID for the lookup
Return value of this multiplication or return 0

Add the value to itself AND then multiply by the below ##

Initial check to see if there is a physical attack penality CH2 (Likely not meeting stats) if true returns negative value of Q12 (unsure as to what this value is just yet)

If the user meets requiremens it performs calculations below
	$AN2 * 0.01 * BI2 * 0.01 + $AO2 * 0.01 * BN2 * 0.01 + $AP2 * 0.01 * BS2 * 0.01 + $AQ2 * 0.01 * BX2 * 0.01 + $AR2 * 0.01 * CC2 * 0.01
breaking this down
	AN2 - correctStr multiplies values from EquipParamWeapons & ReinforceParam Weapons or returns 0
		takes correctStrength property from EquipParamWeapon using weaponID + affinity as an ID for the lookup (affinity obtained from lookup for heavy, keen etc)
		takes correctStrength value at index of reinforceTypeId (standard/twinkling) added to reinforcement level (+25,+10)
	* 0.01
	* BI2 - StrengthCorrect_byPhysics Checks multiple values returning a singular value
		Checks bool value of isStrengthCorrect_byPhysics in AttackElementCorrectParam using the attackElementCorrectId from EquipParamWeapon as the ID for lookup
		If the value is false it returns 0 if it is true another check is made
		gets the correctType_Physics (Cell AY) value using weaponId + affinity as an index from EquipParamWeapon
		correctTypePhysics used as an ID for lookup in CalcCorrectGraphEZ using the final Str value as the column to return the value
	* 0.01
	+ A02 correctDex multiplies values from EquipParamWeapons & ReinforceParamWeapons or returns 0
	  takes correctAgility at index of the ID of weapon + affinity (infusion related to a number)
	  takes correctAgilityRate where id is Reinforcement level (+25,+10) added to reinforceTypeId (standard/twinkling)
	* 0.01
	* BN2 DexterityCorrect_by_Physics Checks multiple values returning a singular value
	  Checks bool value of isDexterityCorrect_byPhysics in AttackElementCorrectParam using the attackElementCorrectId from EquipParamWeapon as the ID for lookup
	  if isDexterityCorrect_byPhysics is false return 0 if it is true go to the next lookup
          gets the correctTypePhysics (Cell AY) value using weaponId + affinity as the ID for the weapon lookup
          correctTypePhysics used as an ID for lookup in CalcCorrectGraphEZ using the final Dex Value + 1 as the final return value
	* 0.01
	+ AP2 - correctInt multiples values from EquipParamWeapon & ReinforceParamWeapon or returns 0 if values not found
	  takes correctMagic property from EquipParamWeapon using weaponId + affinity as the sortId to locate
	  takes correctMagicRate property from ReinforceParamWeapon using Reinforcement level + reinforceTypeId as the ID to locate value
	* 0.01
	* BS2 MagicCorrect_byPhysics Checks multiple values returning a singular value
	  Checks bool value of isMagicCorrect_byPhysics in AttackElementCorrectParam using the attackElementCorrectId from EquipParamWeapon as the ID for lookup
	  If false return - if it is true another check is made
	  gets the correctTypePhysics (Cell AY) value in EquipParamWeapon using the weapon id + affinity as an id for the lookup
	  correctTypePhysics used as an ID for lookup in CalcCorrectGraphEZ using the final Int value + 1 as the column to return value
		
	* 0.01
	+ AQ2 correctFth multiplies two values or returns 0
	  takes correctFaith property from EquipParamWeapon using weaponID + affinity as an ID for the lookup
	  takes correctFaithRate property from ReinforceParamWeapon using the reinforcement level + reinforcementTypeId from EquipParamWeapon as ID for lookup

	* 0.01
	* BX2 FaithCorrect_byPhysics Checks multiple values and returns a singular value
	  Checks bool value of isFaithCorrect_byPhysics in AttackElementCorrectParam using the attackElementCorrectId from EquipParamWeapon as the ID for lookup
	  If false return 0 if true make another check
	  gets the correctTypePhysics (Cell AY) value in EquipParamWeapon using the weapon id + affinity as an id for the lookup
	  correctTypePhysics used as an ID for lookup in CalcCorrectGraphEZ using the final faith value + 1 as the column to return the valye
	* 0.01
	+ AR2 correctArc multiplies values from EquipParamWeapons & ReinforceParamWeapon or returns 0
	  gets correctLuck from EquipmentParamWeapon using weaponID + affinity as id for lookup
	  gets correctLuckRate from ReinforceParamWeapon using the Reinforce level + reinforceTypeId as ID for the lookup
	* 0.01 
	* CC2 LuckCorrect_byPhysics Checks multiple values and returns a singular value
	  Checks bool value of isLuckCorrect_byPhysics in AttackElementCorrectParam using the attackElementCorrectId from EquipParamWeapon as the ID for lookup
	  if false return 0 if true do next check
	  gets the correctTypePhysics (Cell AY) value in EquipParamWeapon using the weapon id + affinity as an id for the lookup
	  correctTypePhysics used as an ID for lookup in CalcCorrectGraphEZ using final arcane value +1 as the column to return the value
	* 0.01 ##
