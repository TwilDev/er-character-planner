Perosnal project allowing players to plan their character beforehand when playing the game.

All images and names used are propery of FromSoftware

A lot of the formulas for calculating player stats were derived from several Wikis primarily http://darksouls.wikidot.com/ that carry over to Fromsoftware's later games including Elden Ring.

 Additional formulas and calculations have been derived from and reverse engineered from a wonderfully useful spreadsheet found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Op36P7gdVMkPzFQX6OsjZcfyUjdGOj7Cjk9qFAVj-U/edit#gid=0 
 
Permission was acquired from the creator & cryptidtracker (Thank you!)

Additional thank yous to members of the Dark Souls modding Discord who helped point me in the right direction to ensure that stats displayed are accurate and formulas follow those found in game

Final thank you to Nate at MugenMoneky.com - another far more complete Character Planner for games across the Souls series for creating their planner and inspiring me to want to take up the challenge and create my own.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
